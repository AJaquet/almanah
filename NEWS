Major new features in version...

0.6.1:
* Backport some fixes for data loss and crasher bugs from master

0.6:
Note that 0.6 removes the old concept of "links", and all stored links will no longer be accessible. They will,
however, remain in the database, and can be accessed using the following commands while Almanah's running:
	sqlite3 ~/.local/share/diary.db
	.headers ON
	SELECT * FROM entry_links;

* Improve accessibility support so the UI's navigable in both Accerciser and GOK
* Rename "links" to "definitions", and change them such that one "definition" can be used across multiple
  diary entries to catalogue things of importance which are relevant to many diary entries
* Concurrently, introduce "events", which are displayed automatically with each diary entry and aim to show
  what you were doing on that day; Evolution appointments and tasks are currently the only supported events
* Add an --import-mode, which allows entries to be edited regardless of their status and the current date to
  allow, for example, a one-time import of a previous diary into Almanah
* Improve printing support, adding page settings, print preview and a default page margin of 20px

0.5:
Note that the database format used in 0.5 is not backwards-compatible
with previous versions, so once an entry has been added in 0.5, the
database will not be usable with previous versions of Almanah.

* Complete the name change to "Almanah Diary"
* Update the architecture, moving to GObject
* Make spell checking optional at compile time
* Add text formatting support

* Fix various translation problems, including untranslatable strings and strings containing markup
* Improve some error messages
* Add icon SVG sources
